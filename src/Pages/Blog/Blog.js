              The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
              test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
              important step in the development process, because if done
              correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
              more difficult to find in later testing stages.

              Vue is generally more suited to smaller, less complex apps and is
              easier to learn from scratch compared to React. Vue can be easier
